## Submission comments
Was asked to change dependency from nlmrt to nlsr. This submission makes that change and fixes any issues associated with it.
Currently, no other package depends on beezdemand.

Thanks, please add a DOI, arXiv or ISBN to your reference Hursh,
Raslear, Bauman, & Black, 1989 in your Description text in the form
authors (year) <doi:...>
authors (year) <arXiv:...>
authors (year, ISBN:...)
with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:' and angle brackets for auto-linking.

* Description has been updated with the DOI for that reference in brackets,
as requested.

We see code lines such as

Copyright 2015 - Baty and Delignette-Muller
Copyright 2016 - John C. Nash
Copyright 2016 - Hadley Wickham
Copyright 2013 - G. Grothendieck
Copyright - 2016 - Ben Bolker
Copyright - 2016 - Paul Johnson <pauljohn@@ku.edu>

Please add all authors and copyright holders in the Authors@R field with
the appropriate roles.

* Those lines indicated package dependencies prior to the submission to
CRAN. The lines are no longer needed as the package now states necessary
dependencies.
