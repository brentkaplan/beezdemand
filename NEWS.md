# beezdemand 0.1.2

* No longer relies on `nlmrt` and instead relies on `nls2`

* Fixes an issue where CheckUnsystematic may not flag certain cases when data are passed as `tibble`

* Fixes deprecated arguments in `ggplot2`

* Add ability to specify a start value for alpha in `ExtraF()` function

# beezdemand 0.1.1

* Add experimental features for `FitCurves()`. These arguments are `constrainq0`, `startq0`, and `startalpha`. These arguments allow Q0 to be constrained so alpha is the only fitted parameter and allow for user-specified starting values.

# beezdemand 0.1.0

* Package successfully on CRAN!

# beezdemand 0.1.00

* Package should be ready for CRAN and is being submitted

# beezdemand 0.0.95

## New updates

* One major change that might affect previous scripts is that in output summary tables, the column formally named ID is now named id (lowercase)

* Cleaned up a few things here and there. The package is close for submission to CRAN as it passes R CMD check with no errors, warnings, or notes

# beezdemand 0.0.91

## New updates

* `GetSharedK()` updated to work better and faster at finding a reasonable value

* Internal helper functions added to optimize `GetSharedK()`

# beezdemand 0.0.90

## New updates

* `ExtraF()` now compares alpha and Q0

* A number of functions now allows you to specify the column names

# beezdemand 0.0.85

## New updates

* `FitCurves()` correctly pulls alpha and q0 standard errors when k is fitted as a free parameter. Also no longer accepts data transformations. Must be done prior to fitting using `ChangeData()`.

* `FitCurves()` now fits mean/pooled data based on `method` argument.

* `GetSharedK()` no longer accepts data transformations.

# beezdemand 0.0.84

## New updates

* New `ChangeData()` will soon serve as the replacement to
  `ReplaceZeros()` and other arguments specified in `FitCurves()`.

* For the time being, `FitCurves()` will actually output a list
  object. This may cause failures with old scripts. Try modifying
  scripts to take the first element out of the list. This will soon be
  taken care of.

## Tidying

* Email contact has been changed and some minor updates to .rd files.

# beezdemand 0.0.6

## New features

* New `FitMeanCurves()` will fit curve to averaged or pooled
  data. Can also make plots.

* `FitCurves()` can now make plots.

* `GetDescriptives()` can make box and whisker plots.

## Cleanup

* Old code from previous workflow is removed. Now all functions use
  longform data.
